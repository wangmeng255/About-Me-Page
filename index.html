			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p> I am Meng and from Beijing, China. I have got my Ph.D. in science in 2012 and then became an assistan professor in <abbr title="National Astronomical Observatories">NAOC</abbr>, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My work mainly focused on <span style="color:#FF6F00"><strong>satellite navigation receiver</strong>, <strong>positioning algorithm</strong> and <strong>error analysis</strong></span>. I co-developed and tested of the satellite navigation system receiver using C to implement multi-task system for satellite positioning and communication, including signal acquisition, tracking, demodulation, SNR estimation, UART, positioning algorithms and etc.. Accomplish Kalman filter can work per second to reduce of receiver positioning error by 40%. I love programming. It can help me implement what I thought. Especially, when I found the little tiny chip can work correctly and show its position. </p>

			<p> I moved to the US in 2013, because of my husband's work. And then, we have our lovely girl. I decided to stay at home to take care her. When I have got my EAD in 2015, I think it is time to have job. Now, I am trying to become a web developer. and become a student in Thinkful to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and so on.</p>
